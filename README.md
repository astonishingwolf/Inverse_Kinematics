# Inverse_Kinematics
This repositary contain inverse kinematics model of 3link planar arm which has been moved in a various trajectory including a circle and a parabola.
The controls of the arm has been done using a PD controller.
The model has been designed in simscape and codes for control have been written in matlab
Below contains a simualtion showing the arm traversing a certain trajectory.
